Module 4 Challenge

In this program I reviewed four different fund portfolios to analyze their respective risk and return. This was done by reviewing and analyzing each one's performance and volatility then creating risk to return profiles.

Description:

The first step I took was importing the data from a CSV file and then reading them into the program.

A variable containing each fund's daily return was created by finding the percent changes and dropping the NA values.

To review the perfomance of the funds' I found the cumulative returns

Volatility of each fund was then visualized by creating box plots of each one's daily returns

In order to analyze the risk we then found the annualized standard deviations for 21-day rolling window

The risk-return was the next aspect to be analyzed using Sharpe ratios

The final step was to choose the two most viable funds using the Sharpe ratios and finding the beta of a 60-day rolling period for each.
